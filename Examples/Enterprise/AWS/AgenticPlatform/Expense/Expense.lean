/-! A proposed Cedar projection of two operations in AWS's agentic platform
expense sample. The source tool currently lists all expenses for listTeamExpenses
and updates a rejection without an AVP call. Base models those observable gaps;
the composed roots are proposed controls, not deployed AWS policies. -/
