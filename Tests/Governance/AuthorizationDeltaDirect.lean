/-!
Direct Cedar evaluation proof for the linked ticket-sharing policy revision.
Two permit conditions add `deviceTrusted`; the third policy is reused. The
proof covers both the decision and erroring-policy set for every Cedar Env.
Its dependency audit checks that it uses only Lean's standard axioms.
